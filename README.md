## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Requirements

- PHP 7.4+
- Composer
- Laravel 8.x
- Weatherbit API key

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/collins-droid/laravel-weather-app.git
   cd laravel-weather-app
   ```

2. Install PHP dependencies:
   ```
   composer install
   ```

3. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and configure your environment variables:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Generate an application key:
   ```
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

5. Configure your database in the `.env` file and run migrations:
   ```
   php artisan migrate
   ```

6. Add your Weatherbit API key to the `.env` file:
   ```
   WEATHERBIT_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the Laravel development server:
   ```
   php artisan serve
   ```

2. Visit `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.

3. Enter a city name and country code to fetch weather data.

## API Integration

This application uses the Weatherbit API. You'll need to sign up for a free account at [Weatherbit.io](https://www.weatherbit.io/) to get an API key.

## Caching

Weather data is cached for 30 minutes to reduce API calls. You can adjust the caching duration in the `WeatherController.php` file.

## Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling for API requests and invalid user inputs. Errors are logged and user-friendly messages are displayed.
